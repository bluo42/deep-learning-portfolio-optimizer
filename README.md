Deep Learning Approaches to Portfolio Optimization

We implement a series of models from the literature, namely LSTM and Transformer architectures that have worked well. We test the inclusion of exogenous variables and saw improvements in performance.
Notebooks contain all the code used to run the experiments and generate the plots in the report.
